##How is it made
___
### HTML & JavaScript
___
I used HTML to create the canvas and used JavaScript to render all the themes and recieve and emit data to my server. JavaScript also detects keypress and gamepads and loads the Main Menu, Singleplayer mode and Multiplayer mode.

### Gampad.js
___
I used Gamepad.js from Neogeek that simplifies the programming of gamepads and detecting the keypresses

[Gampad.js](https://github.com/neogeek/gamepad.js)

### Node.js
___
For my backend I used node.js.
#### Socket.io
I used Socket.io to use websockets and connect people and emit and recieve data if the player is in multiplayer mode.
#### Express
I used express to send the files to the user and to run a server.

### MongoDB
For the leaderboard I used MongoDB and used [MLab](https://mlab.com) to store the highest 10 scores. Only the top 10 scores are stored so the database doesn't get full.
